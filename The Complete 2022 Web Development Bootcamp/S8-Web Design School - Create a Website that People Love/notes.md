# Web Design 

Web design can be split into four different pillars: Color Theory, Typography, UI Design and UX Experience.

## Color Theory

It is best to try to choose colors that are either complementary in order to make a design pop, or to choose analogous colors to make things go well together.

## Typography

Fonts are also another way to showcase presence and design. Take comic-sans for example. It is not a serious font, and is deemed as a childish font-style.
It is considered unprofessional. Additionally, most fonts that are required for professional papers are a sans-serif font, and thus is the most utilized font-family of web
development.

## UI Design

Designs need to be going for the overall theme. Depending on the theme or how you want to display thing, whitespace knowledge, is a must.

## UX Experience

Overall, this should be simple. Shouldn't let a customer struggle with the overall design.
